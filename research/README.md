Research
--------

The Research folder contains all the material generated while doing the research where each folder represents the topic of  research. We aim to make our research that we do, or that we may inspire in the future to be :-

   - Reproducable
   - Understandable
   - Collabarative

To ensure the above 3 we encourage to follow the following structure for the research folders

Structure
---------

./research
|   +-- topic-of-research
|   |    +-- notebooks
|   |    |   +-- research_trial.ipynb
|   |    |   +-- another_research_trail.ipynb
|   |    +-- code
|   |    |   +-- code.py
|   |    |   +-- another_code.py
|   |    +-- README.md


All the research trials go into ipython notebooks in the `notebooks` folder, the code generated based on the research goes into `code` as it might not always be simple to integrate the code directly into production.The Readme contains description of the idea and overall an idea of the process.

Contribute
----------

To contribute you are welcomed to fork and start a research project or start a research project in your personal github repositories and we can add that as a submodule to this folder, feel free to start discussions on a research topic that you may have in mind.

Incase you have forked the repo open a pull request and assign to it either @heaven00 or @gggodhwani for review and if you have your own repo for the research mark us in one of your commits or start a discussion about it.
